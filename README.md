# ResponsibleCitizensPortal
Inspiration and Idea behind the project : In 2020 everyone faced very difficult / different situation for first time in modern history the 'Covid Pandemic'. We noticed #poor co-operation between government and people, #unclear instructions and confusions, #fake news, #difficulties faced by lower income groups, #starvation of stray animals thats about pandemic situation, apart from that, there are many sensitive and conscious people in society who want to do good tasks like tree plantations, donations, cleaning, beach cleaning, spread awareness, revolt against injustice but they don't find Courage to do those tasks themselves and there is no-one to take initiative and thus all the ideas die. Using this portal You can take initiative or also can join initiative created by others. After all 'Birds of a feather flock Together'."  
Now how to run the project
